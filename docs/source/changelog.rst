Releases
---------------------

v4.2.0
=====================
- Deprecated parameters will now raise an exception:

  - :class:`daf.guild.AutoGUILD` and :class:`daf.message.AutoCHANNEL`:

    - ``include_pattern``: :class:`TypeError` when using :class:`str`. Logical operators are now required.
    - ``exclude_pattern``: :class:`NameError` when used.

  - :class:`daf.message.TextMESSAGE`,
    :class:`daf.message.VoiceMESSAGE` and
    :class:`daf.message.DirectMESSAGE`:

    - ``start_period``: :class:`NameError` when used.
    - ``end_period``: :class:`NameError` when used.
    - ``start_in``: :class:`NameError` when used.
    - ``data`` parameter now requires subclasses of ``BaseMessageData`` instead of plain types.
      Additionally, the ``data_function`` can no longer be used and has been removed completely.



v4.1.1
=====================
- Fixed segmentation-fault crash when using Python 3.12+.


v4.1.0
=====================
- New message period types:
  
  + :class:`daf.message.messageperiod.NamedDayOfYearPeriod`
  + :class:`daf.message.messageperiod.NamedDayOfMonthPeriod`

- Added optional case-sensitive matching to :class:`daf.logic.contains` and :class:`daf.logic.regex`. The default
  is still case-insensitive.
- For word matching, the :class:`daf.logic.contains` now accepts multiple words inside seperated by a space.
- Added ``constraints`` parameter to :class:`daf.message.TextMESSAGE`. See :ref:`Message constraints` for more
  information.
- Fixed SQL log removal through the GUI.
- Fixed CSV and JSON reading through remote.
- Fixed exception when GUI tried to print a message.
- Fixed invite ``invite_track`` attribute error in :class:`daf.guild.AutoGUILD`.
- Fixed properties not being refreshed when pressing the ``Refresh`` button inside the GUI (``Live view`` tab).
- Fixed update failure when using :class:`daf.guild.AutoGUILD` (cache was not invalidated).
- |BREAK_CH| Disabled the :ref:`Automatic guild discovery and join` features due to the search provider shutting down its
  services. It will be reenabled in a future version.


v4.0.5
=====================
- Fixed exe build.

v4.0.4
=====================
- Fixed automatic responder's not being removable over a remote connection.
- Fixed casting error when trying to update objects with ``Literal`` parameters.
- Other GUI fixes (from tkclasswiz library)


v4.0.3
====================
- Fixed object editing window saving to an incorrect index (and removing other objects).


v4.0.2
====================
- Fixed automatic responders not being serializable.

v4.0.1
====================
- Fixed remote serialization of regex and time.

v4.0.0
===================
- New automatic message responder (DM and guild) - :ref:`Automatic responder`.
- Changed message's parameters:

  + Deprecated:
  
    * ``start_in``
    * ``start_period``
    * ``end_period``
    * All existing ``data`` types. They have been replaced with :class:`daf.messagedata.TextMessageData`
      and :class:`daf.messagedata.DynamicMessageData`

- Changed :class:`~daf.guild.AutoGUILD`'s parameters:

  + Deprecated:
  
    * ``exclude_pattern``
    * Using :class:`str` on ``include_pattern``
  
  + Changed:

    * Made ``include_pattern`` accept :ref:`logic classes <Text matching (logic)>`
      (``and_``, ``or_``, ``contains``, ...)

- Changed :class:`~daf.message.autochannel.AutoCHANNEL`'s parameters:

  + Deprecated:
  
    * ``exclude_pattern``
    * Using :class:`str` on ``include_pattern``
  
  + Changed:

    * Made ``include_pattern`` accept :ref:`logic classes <Text matching (logic)>`
      (``and_``, ``or_``, ``contains``, ...)

- Upon slow-mode / timeout, messages will now longer wait until the end of slow-mode / timeout.
  Instead, they will defer until the next period that is not within slow-mode / timeout.
  The period will however still auto-correct itself to be above the slow-mode.
- |BREAK_CH| Changed how :class:`daf.guild.AutoGUILD` works. It will now create :class:`daf.guild.GUILD` instances.
  :py:attr:`daf.guild.AutoGUILD.guilds` will also now return a list of generated :class:`daf.guild.GUILD` objects instead
  of a list of :class:`discord.Guild` objects.
  This also prevents a "bug" that appeared if the user was timed-out in a guild, which reflected upon other
  guilds as well. The added benefit of creating :class:`~daf.guild.GUILD` is different randomized sending
  periods across multiple guilds (assuming randomized sending period was configured).
- |BREAK_CH| Removed the deprecated ``daf.dtypes.AUDIO``, which has been replaced with :class:`daf.dtypes.FILE`.
- |POTENT_BREAK_CH| Changed event names
- GUI:

  - Theme selection support (top-left corner)


v3.2.2
===================
- Fixed entire software not launching if SQL is not installed.
  The problem was some SQL classes were not defined.


v3.2.1
===================

  a rate limit happened (or slow mode).
- Fixed selenium timer reset when no join attempt was triggered.


v3.1.1
===================
- Fixed guild and text channels not fully visible in property view of GUI.


v3.1.0
===================
- Compatible with Python 3.12
- GUI:
  
  - ViewOnly structured data will display only the data that is provided, meaning
    the GUI will not be constructed based on type annotations of an objects, but rather
    based on the data itself.
  - Better toast notification format and compatibility across multiple DPI screens.
  - Graphical object library split into a separate package.

- :class:`daf.logging.LoggerJSON`:
  - ``index`` field is now a unique snowflake-like ID (used for removing logs).
  - |BREAK_CH| Invite logs will now contain a "member" dictionary
  for each invite log.
  - Analytics are now supported.

- LoggerCSV:
  - Analytics are now supported.
  - ``index`` field added in order to allow removal of logs.

- |BREAK_CH| Removed long time deprecated package "framework", which was the original import.

- Added missing :py:attr:`daf.guild.AutoGUILD.removed_messages` property.

v3.0.1
====================
- Downgraded Selenium version from 4.13 to 4.12 since 4.13 does not support headless, which
  undetected-chrome-driver is trying to set.

v3.0.0
====================
- SQL analytics:
  
  - Counts now have better error reporting when an invalid value was passed.

- GUI:

  - Higher refresh rate due to threading redesign - instead of calling Tkinter's root.update inside an asyncio task,
    the root.mainroot is called directly, while the asyncio event loop is running inside another thread.
  - The GUI will not block the asyncio tasks (explained in previous bullet).
  - When saving a new object definition, if the type of a parameter is literal, the value will be pre-checked inside
    the GUI and an exception will be raised if a valid value is not given.
  - Properties that start with ``_`` will no longer be displayed when viewing live structured objects.
  - Toast notifications for :func:`~daf.logging.tracing.trace`.
  - Parameter validation for literals, enums and bool.
  - Copy / Paste globally for both drop-down menus and list menus.

- Core:

  - New events system and module
  - Updated PyCord API wrapper to 2.5.0 RC5
  - New property :py:attr:`daf.client.ACCOUNT.removed_servers` for tracking removed servers.
  - New property :py:attr:`daf.guild.GUILD.removed_messages` :py:attr:`daf.guild.USER.removed_messages`
    for tracking removed messages.
  - New parameter ``removal_buffer_length`` to :class:`daf.client.ACCOUNT` for setting maximum amount of
    of servers to keep in the :py:attr:`daf.client.ACCOUNT.removed_servers` buffer.
  - New parameter ``removal_buffer_length`` to :class:`daf.guild.GUILD` and :class:`daf.guild.USER`
    for setting maximum amount of messages to keep in the :py:attr:`daf.guild.GUILD.removed_messages`
    / :py:attr:`daf.guild.USER.removed_messages` buffer.

  - Event loop based API - All API methods that get called now submit an event in the event loop, which causes
    the API call to happen asynchronously unless awaited with ``await`` keyword. This also makes DAF
    much more efficient.

  - Remote:

    - Persistent WebSocket connection for receiving events from the core server
      (eg. :func:`~daf.logging.tracing.trace()` events).


  - Removed ``remaining_before_removal`` property from all message classes.
  - Added ``remove_after`` property to :class:`~daf.guild.GUILD`, :class:`~daf.guild.USER`,
    :class:`~daf.message.TextMESSAGE`, :class:`~daf.message.VoiceMESSAGE` and :class:`~daf.message.DirectMESSAGE`.

- Fixed files not having full path in the logs.
- Added :py:attr:`daf.dtypes.FILE.fullpath` to support the previous fix.
- Fixed exception when adding messages inside AutoGUILD, when one of the cached guilds fails initialization.
- Fixed serialization for :class:`discord.VoiceChannel`, which included slowmode_delay,
  even though the attribute doesn't exist in the VoiceChannel.

  - New parameter: ``auto_publish`` to :class:`~daf.message.TextMESSAGE` for automatically publishing messages sent to
    announcement (news) channels.

  - :class:`~daf.message.TextMESSAGE` and :class:`~daf.message.VoiceMESSAGE`'s ``remove_after`` parameter:

    - If integer, it will now work independently for each channel and will only decrement on successful sends.
    - If :class:`~datetime.datetime` or :class:`~datetime.timedelta`, it will work the same as before.

  - Moderation timeout handling (messages resume one minute after moderation timeout expiry)
  - Message content:

    - Deprecated :class:`daf.dtypes.AUDIO`, replaced with :class:`daf.dtypes.FILE`.
    - :class:`daf.dtypes.FILE` now accepts binary data as well and will load the data from ``filename`` at creation
      if the ``data`` parameter is not given.

- Web browser (Selenium):

  - Time between each guild join is now 45 seconds.

  - The GUI now has a dropdown menu where users can select between a local connection client and a remote connection client.
    Local connection client won't use the HTTP API, but will start DAF locally and interact with it directly.

- GUI:
  
  - Method execution
  - Executing method status window.
  - When editing objects, the Y size will now be set to default size every time the frame changes.
  - When executing async blocking functions, a progress bar window will be shown to indicate something is happening.

  This was deprecated in some older version and now removed.

- |BREAK_CH| Removed DEPRECATED functionality inside ``add_object`` that allowed guilds to be added without passing the account
  to ``snowflake`` parameter. Before it implicitly took the first account from the shill list. This has been
